# project_dl
In this project, we initially implemented our model using a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), then advanced to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, and finally explored Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Each architecture offers unique advantages and may perform differently depending on the nature of the data and the task at hand.
